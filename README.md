In this hands-on project, I'll follow professional practices for starting a business intelligence data analytics project. 

## Overview
Calculate the total revenue generated by each customer. 
Understanding which customers contribute the most to overall sales can help businesses target their most valuable customers for loyalty programs or personalized marketing.

## Required Data Columns
- CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer.
- SaleAmount: Total revenue from each sale.

## Data Preparation Steps
- Ensure that each transaction is associated with the correct customer.

## Calculation Instructions
1. Group transactions by CustomerID.
2. Sum SaleAmount for each customer.

## Expected Outcome
A list of customers and the total revenue they have generated.

## Data-Driven Decision (DDDM)
KPI: Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) or Total Revenue per Customer.
- Action: Identify high-revenue customers to target them for loyalty programs, upselling, or exclusive offers, while identifying low-revenue customers who may benefit from promotional incentives.

## Setup Guide (Windows)
